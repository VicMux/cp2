                <p>The belly dance is my personal favorite. The belly moves to the music. 
Arms waving, torsos twisting, hips swaying, spines flexing, we trumpet and stomp around the room. The floor is slick with sweat and the air with grunts and groans.</p>
<p>“Heavy feet, heavy legs, I want heavy legs” shouts Linda. “Remember you guys are African elephants, move your trunks, wave them, now dip, drink some water with your trunks.” Linda, thin and graceful as a gazelle prances about as we ponderous pachyderms shift about listlessly.
Welcome to the African dance class at our local gym. There are about 20 of us in the room today, following lithe Linda’s instructions and mimicking elephants, lionesses and sinuous snakes’ twists and turns. I see, in the massive mirrors around the room that I look more like a hippo resisting acupuncture than a slithery snake as I try the impossible spine twists .Out of the corner of my eye, I spy my neighbor pinching herself to keep from laughing too hard at me!</p>
<p>“Snakes don’t have bones,” I want to hiss, “and neither do you.” I smile instead, ignore her and slither my way with dignity, across, to the back of the class. Standing serenely with her feet wrapped around her ears is an old lady. She untangles three fingers out of some impossible pretzel twist to wiggle her fingers at me. Show off!</p>
<p>Propping my tired neighbor up with my hip, I am part of the tribal community circle now, holding hands and trying the butterfly slap with my knees while whipping my head back and forth . Linda oblivious to the pain around her, flits by us, knees slapping, torso flexing, head whipping looking impossibly fresh and gorgeous. Holding hands we run around in a circle first one way, then the other. Tripping over the sarong I’ve tied around my waist as part of the African look, I fall flat on my face and am lifted up with considerable difficulty by the other dancers. Not letting a minor mishap deter me I plod on, waving my arms like a butterfly flying around the room searching for nectar. Then we do the Pay -pay, the travel dance. We shuffle, first to the right, then left, our hands groping around, checking the territory for danger before undertaking a journey, we are informed.</p>
<p>I have never felt closer to Africa, recurring images of prancing among the chimps and hyenas in the Serengeti plains haunt my vision as I do the monkey twist. My husband assures me that my moves will probably save me from any danger, so intimidating, he says, is the sight of me doing the African dance. Come to think of it, he has been filling my desk with attractive brochures of the continent, always urging me to travel there, sans family.</p>
<p>The belly dance is a personal favorite, as my belly has a way of moving to the music even as I stand still. I notice that there are many bellies doing their own thing this morning, some moving so vigorously that I move away from them as discreetly as I can. By now, sweating and panting, I sense a collective urge in the room to return to the US of A. Sluggish hands grope the air trying to capture good spirits while tired legs kick aside forces holding us back. Linda, enthusiastic as ever, expresses an urge to be one with the earth and yearning to still our shaking limbs and dancing bellies, we sink to the ground gratefully.</p>
<p>We thank the exhausted earth for bearing our weight and for tolerating the assault we have put her through. Staggering out of the gym, I see lissome Linda heading to teach the aerobics class. I decide to join her, but change my mind when a friend offers me a Danish pastry for lunch. I end up devouring four.
I can’t wait for Wednesday morning, when we will have the next African dance class.</p>
