                <p>This is going under the premise that most desi parents are dummies…if there are any, who are not, please do inform me and I shall name and shame you if you so desire!</p>
<p>What would Nirupa Roy do? 
If you, as a desi parent look to the Bollywood films of the 80's (like I do) for parenting advice on teenage dating, god help you!
The unspoken rule in our household as I suspect, it is in many desi ones are that our kids would start dating when they turned 30 and driving a year after.</p>
<p>As a mom of a 18 year old son and a 15 year old daughter, I realize, (and oh boy) how hard it is to ride the cusp- of cool and plain old fashioned hick! All the double standards I 
faced, as a rebel teenager at the hands of my parents way back when, is the norm in my abode today. 
While our kids go through what is a transitional period in life known as 'young adulthood', as parents we hope that with new privileges there will come a sense of responsibility and 
honor. With pop culture bombarding our children with messages of sex and violence and instant gratification, desi parents hope that at least a small percentage of the advise they had 
imparted to their children about 'Indian culture' will prevail and help their children make the right judgments.
When over zealous desi parents (are there any other kind?) urge their offspring to adapt to everything American, compete and work with their peers, when it comes to dating, we suddenly 
remember our sexually repressed middle-class moralities.</p>
<p>When I suspected that my son, who was a month short of 18, had a girlfriend, I did what every self respecting desi mom would do! I tattled to his dad. 
I then ransacked his room, looking for her picture, and any clues that would lead me to her.
Confronting him was left to the end.
And he answered my queries with his trademark, 'No big deal, Mom.'
When two different girls asked him out to the High School Senior prom and junior prom, we raised our brows (and our BP) but let him be.
Seeing him off to the proms, conflicting thoughts crashed around in my head.
'I can't imagine any mother feeling that her daughter is safe with my son!'
'My son is too good for any of these girls'.
Desi parents that we are, we blushed when we heard girls scream his name out loud as he sang and rapped with his band. As our first born has always been a free spirited, rebellious 
young man, we were cautious about coming down too hard with the rules. But some basic rules were established, night time curfew, no sleepovers, to name two of the most important ones.
Nirupa Roy would've welcomed the bahu with an aarti and wide smile, we saw her for the first time, lounging around in the family room couch, casual and very friendly.
These days the girl inhabits our home, unabashedly and happily when our son visits from college. Actually, we suspect that the trips he makes home are sorely for the purpose of meeting 
her than for any parental devotion that he may be subject to. She is a sweet Jewish girl, who eats with us, talks to us freely, laughs with us and has even memorized a Sanskrit poem my 
son has taught her.</p>
<p>Being or trying to be the 'cool' parents that we are, we forgive them their transgressions (I remember my teen years, I was always so in love with something or someone all the time) 
but we do make sure we tell our female offspring that such behavior will not be tolerated if she was the one to practice it. And we are struck dumb when she asks the obvious questions. 
Double standards?" Heck, yes! 
In Malayalam, a language that I understand but do not speak as well, there is a saying, "Whether a thorn falls on a flower or a flower on a thorn, the damage is always on the flower." 
When I quote this, there is always an audible grown and protest from the whole family.</p>
<p>"Girls" I profess to my indignant daughter "tend to lose so much more than boys, when it comes to relationships." My little girl throws up her hands and so do I, mentally, as I hear 
myself! This is the mindset I tried rebelling against, butting my head against years ago, when I was a free- thinking teen myself!
I decided to talk to other desi parents about this thorny issue. Most of them agreed with me, they professed a hope that their daughters wouldn't get 'involved' till they were well into 
their twenties, while most didn't mind their sons 'going out.' Is this a  traditional Indian patriarchal attitude or practical wisdom?
There was one desi parent who admitted that she hoped both her son and daughter would get involved in relationships, that she thought would help them grow and mature as adults.
American parents were shocked that I would even ask them this question! They had dated when young and thought that this was indeed a give, that one would have a boyfriend/girlfriend 
when in High School. They also admitted that some trends are healthier now than they were when they were growing up. These days, teens who are not  'single' are not called 'gay', as 
they were years ago. And also, biases against single-sex relationships have ebbed.
Desi teens I talked to looked at me pityingly, implying 'you really don't get it, do you?'
Most of them were supremely confident, happy young men and women, content to be what they are and where in life they were. 80% of them confessed that they hope to get into relationships 
in the first year of college.
A serious issue was also raised when desi girls admitted that desi boys preferred to go out with American girls, because the latter were 'easier'. The policy was summed up thus 'Desi 
boys don't like to date desi girls but when it comes to marriage, they only want us!'</p>
<p>Confronted by these difficult dilemmas, I have decided to come out and admit that as a desi parent I do enforce unfair rules. What is good for the gander may not be good for the goose. 
At least for the goose in my house.  And my justification rings true even to my ears - girls do tend to lose more in casual romantic relationships than boys.
So, for the time being, we are letting our son know that we believe in his judgment and respect the choices that he makes. And that as a man he has an added burden, to respect and 
protect the girl he is with. </p>
<p>And we are letting our daughter know that the same rule applies to her - no dating till she is 30!!</p>
